    <p>

      Wavenumber is a “full-stack” product design and communication organization.  
      We combine content,  industrial design, and engineering to tell product stories. 
      Our clients benefit by having a trusted partner to both develop and communicate their product. 
      We understand the importance of the "why" as well as the "how", aligning engineering development with sales and marketing strategies.

    </p>
       
    <p>We value real, honest relationships and take our work seriously. Successful outcomes are achieved
      through application of our "full-stack" values.</p>

         <h2> Create</h2>
         <div class = "m2r">
            <p>
              Understand that you literally become what you think about. Bring to the world that which is not. Move toward how we want out things to be.  Take action,  collaborate and build teams.   Iterate and refine.    Be resilient and persevere.     
           </p>
          </div>

          <h2>Communicate</h2>
          <div class = "m2r">
              <p>
                  Tell stories about the “why” and connect to a purpose.  Freely give what we know and embrace a mindset of generosity.   Actively listen and be ready take the role of student and teacher.  Become comfortable with being vulnerable.
              </p>
          </div>
          
          <h2>Serve</h2>
          <div class = "m2r">
          <p>
          Be the best by helping others be their best.  Cultivate empathy and express gratitude.     Give more than you ever expect to receive.   Lead through service to others.    Enable and empower others.
          </p>
