  <p>We are a team bound by principles, not just technical acumen. What makes us different is mindset. We strive for the best outcomes using two core principles.</p>

  <h3>Growth</h3>
  
  <div class = "m2r">	
  <p>
    Freely give what you know and embrace a mindset of generosity. Eschew the scarcity mindset. Consider what you can add instead of what is available to take.
  </p>
  </div>
  
   <h3>Ownership</h3>
   <div class="m2r">
 
   <p>
  Take complete ownership of outcomes. Do what you say and make sure your word means something.   Learn from failure and be ready to grow.   Be accountable and do what is right even when no one is looking.
